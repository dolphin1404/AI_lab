      "original_text": "The Period\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of\nwisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it\nwas the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the\nseason of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of\ndespair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were\nall going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in\nshort, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its\nnoisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for\nevil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n\nThere were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\nthrone of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with\na fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer\nthan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,\nthat things in general were settled for ever.\n\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\nSpiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\nas at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\nblessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\nheralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were\nmade for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane\nghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its\nmessages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\ndeficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\nearthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,\nfrom a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange\nto relate, have proved more important to the human race than any\ncommunications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane\nbrood.\n\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\nsister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\nhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\nChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\nachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\ntorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\nkneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\nwhich passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty\nyards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and\nNorway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,\nalready marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into\nboards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in\nit, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses\nof some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were\nsheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with\nrustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\nthe Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\nthe Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\nunceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\nwith muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\nthat they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\n\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\njustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\nhighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\nfamilies were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\ntheir furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman\nin the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\nchallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\n“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\nmail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\nthen got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the\nfailure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;\nthat magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\nand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\nillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London\ngaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law\nfired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;\nthieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at\nCourt drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search\nfor contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the\nmusketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences\nmuch out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy\nand ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing\nup long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on\nSaturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the\nhand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of\nWestminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,\nand to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of\nsixpence.\n\nAll these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close\nupon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\nEnvironed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,\nthose two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the\nfair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\nwith a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred\nand seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small\ncreatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the\nroads that lay before them.",

      "original_text": "The Mail\n\nIt was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,\nbefore the first of the persons with whom this history has business.\nThe Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up\nShooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,\nas the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish\nfor walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,\nand the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the\nhorses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the\ncoach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\nto Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\ncombination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose\notherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals\nare endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to\ntheir duty.\n\nWith drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through\nthe thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were\nfalling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested\nthem and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the\nnear leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\nunusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\nhill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\nnervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\n\nThere was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\nforlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\nnone. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\nair in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\nwaves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\neverything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\nand a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\ninto it, as if they had made it all.\n\nTwo other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\nside of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\nears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\nanything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\nhidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\nthe eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers\nwere very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\nthe road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,\nwhen every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\n“the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\nnon-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard\nof the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\nthousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as\nhe stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\nand keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\nloaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\ndeposited on a substratum of cutlass.\n\nThe Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\nthe passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\nall suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\nthe horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\ntaken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\njourney.\n\n“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the\ntop and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to\nit!--Joe!”\n\n“Halloa!” the guard replied.\n\n“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”\n\n“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”\n\n“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s\nyet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”\n\nThe emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,\nmade a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\nsuit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its\npassengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach\nstopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three\nhad had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\ninto the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of\ngetting shot instantly as a highwayman.\n\nThe last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\nstopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\nthe descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\n\n“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his\nbox.\n\n“What do you say, Tom?”\n\nThey both listened.\n\n“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”\n\n“_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold\nof the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the king’s\nname, all of you!”\n\nWith this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on\nthe offensive.\n\nThe passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;\nthe two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He\nremained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained\nin the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,\nand from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked\nback and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up\nhis ears and looked back, without contradicting.\n\nThe stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring\nof the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\nindeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to\nthe coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the\npassengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the\nquiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding\nthe breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\n\nThe sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\n\n“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand!\nI shall fire!”\n\nThe pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,\na man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”\n\n“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”\n\n“_Is_ that the Dover mail?”\n\n“Why do you want to know?”\n\n“I want a passenger, if it is.”\n\n“What passenger?”\n\n“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”\n\nOur booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,\nthe coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.\n\n“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,\n“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in\nyour lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”\n\n“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering\nspeech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”\n\n(“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to\nhimself. “He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)\n\n“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”\n\n“What is the matter?”\n\n“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”\n\n“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the\nroad--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two\npassengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and\npulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing wrong.”\n\n“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ‘Nation sure of that,” said the\nguard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”\n\n“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.\n\n“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters to that\nsaddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m a devil\nat a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So\nnow let’s look at you.”\n\nThe figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,\nand came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider\nstooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger\na small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and\nrider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of\nthe man.\n\n“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.\n\nThe watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised\nblunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,\nanswered curtly, “Sir.”\n\n“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You must\nknow Tellson’s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown\nto drink. I may read this?”\n\n“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”\n\nHe opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and\nread--first to himself and then aloud: “‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’\nIt’s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED\nTO LIFE.”\n\nJerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”\nsaid he, at his hoarsest.\n\n“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as\nwell as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”\n\nWith those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at\nall assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted\ntheir watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general\npretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape\nthe hazard of originating any other kind of action.\n\nThe coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round\nit as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss\nhaving looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,\nlooked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a\nfew smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was\nfurnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown\nand stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut\nhimself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,\nand get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in\nfive minutes.\n\n“Tom!” softly over the coach roof.\n\n“Hallo, Joe.”\n\n“Did you hear the message?”\n\n“I did, Joe.”\n\n“What did you make of it, Tom?”\n\n“Nothing at all, Joe.”\n\n“That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it\nmyself.”\n\nJerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not\nonly to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and\nshake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of\nholding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his\nheavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within\nhearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the\nhill.\n\n“After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won’t trust your\nfore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger,\nglancing at his mare. “‘Recalled to life.’ That’s a Blazing strange\nmessage.

          "The Mail\n\nIt was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,\nbefore the first of the persons with whom this history has business.\n",
          "The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up\nShooter’s Hill.",
          "He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,\nas the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish\nfor walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,\nand the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the\nhorses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the\ncoach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\nto Blackheath.",
          "Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\ncombination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose\notherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals\nare endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to\ntheir duty.\n\n",
          "With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through\nthe thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were\nfalling to pieces at the larger joints.",
          "As often as the driver rested\nthem and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho!",
          "so-ho-then!”",
          "the\nnear leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\nunusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\nhill.",
          "Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\nnervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\n\n",
          "There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\nforlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\nnone.",
          "A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\nair in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\nwaves of an unwholesome sea might do.",
          "It was dense enough to shut out\neverything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\nand a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\ninto it, as if they had made it all.\n\n",
          "Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\nside of the mail.",
          "All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\nears, and wore jack-boots.",
          "Not one of the three could have said, from\nanything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\nhidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\nthe eyes of the body, of his two companions.",
          "In those days, travellers\nwere very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\nthe road might be a robber or in league with robbers.",
          "As to the latter,\nwhen every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\n“the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\nnon-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards.",
          "So the guard\nof the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\nthousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as\nhe stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\nand keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\nloaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\ndeposited on a substratum of cutlass.\n\n",
          "The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\nthe passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\nall suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\nthe horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\ntaken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\njourney.\n\n",

      "original_text": "The Night Shadows\n\nA wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is\nconstituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A\nsolemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every\none of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every\nroom in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating\nheart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of\nits imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the\nawfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I\nturn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time\nto read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable\nwater, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses\nof buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the\nbook should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read\nbut a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an\neternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood\nin ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,\nmy love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable\nconsolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that\nindividuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end. In\nany of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there\na sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their\ninnermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?\n\nAs to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the\nmessenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the\nfirst Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the\nthree passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail\ncoach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had\nbeen in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the\nbreadth of a county between him and the next.\n\nThe messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at\nale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his\nown counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that\nassorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with\nno depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they\nwere afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too\nfar apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like\na three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and\nthroat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped\nfor drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he\npoured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he\nmuffled again.\n\n“No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.\n“It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn’t\nsuit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don’t think he’d\nbeen a drinking!”\n\nHis message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several\ntimes, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,\nwhich was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all\nover it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was\nso like Smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked\nwall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might\nhave declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.\n\nWhile he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night\nwatchman in his box at the door of Tellson’s Bank, by Temple Bar, who\nwas to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the\nnight took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such\nshapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.\nThey seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.\n\nWhat time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon\nits tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,\nlikewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms\ntheir dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.\n\nTellson’s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank\npassenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what\nlay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,\nand driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special\njolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little\ncoach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the\nbulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great\nstroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,\nand more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with\nall its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then\nthe strong-rooms underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable\nstores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a\nlittle that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among\nthem with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them\nsafe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.\n\nBut, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach\n(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was\nalways with him, there was another current of impression that never\nceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one\nout of a grave.\n\nNow, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him\nwas the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did\nnot indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by\nyears, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,\nand in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,\ndefiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;\nso did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands\nand figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was\nprematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this\nspectre:\n\n“Buried how long?”\n\nThe answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”\n\n“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”\n\n“Long ago.”\n\n“You know that you are recalled to life?”\n\n“They tell me so.”\n\n“I hope you care to live?”\n\n“I can’t say.”\n\n“Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”\n\nThe answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes\nthe broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.”\nSometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,\n“Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it\nwas, “I don’t know her. I don’t understand.”\n\nAfter such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,\nand dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his\nhands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth\nhanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The\npassenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the\nreality of mist and rain on his cheek.\n\nYet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving\npatch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating\nby jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train\nof the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the\nreal business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express\nsent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out\nof the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost\nit again.\n\n“Buried how long?”\n\n“Almost eighteen years.”\n\n“I hope you care to live?”\n\n“I can’t say.”\n\nDig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two\npassengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm\nsecurely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two\nslumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again\nslid away into the bank and the grave.\n\n“Buried how long?”\n\n“Almost eighteen years.”\n\n“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”\n\n“Long ago.”\n\nThe words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in\nhis hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary\npassenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the\nshadows of the night were gone.\n\nHe lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a\nridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left\nlast night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,\nin which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained\nupon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,\nand the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.\n\n“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious\nCreator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!”",

      "original_text": "The Preparation\n\nWhen the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,\nthe head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his\ncustom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey\nfrom London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous\ntraveller upon.\n\nBy that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be\ncongratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective\nroadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp\nand dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather\nlike a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out\nof it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and\nmuddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.\n\n“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”\n\n“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The\ntide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,\nsir?”\n\n“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”\n\n“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.\nShow Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off\ngentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)\nFetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”\n\nThe Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the\nmail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from\nhead to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the\nRoyal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,\nall kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another\ndrawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all\nloitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord\nand the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a\nbrown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large\nsquare cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to\nhis breakfast.\n\nThe coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman\nin brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,\nwith its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,\nthat he might have been sitting for his portrait.\n\nVery orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a\nloud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,\nas though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and\nevanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain\nof it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a\nfine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He\nwore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his\nhead: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which\nlooked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.\nHis linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,\nwas as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring\nbeach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A\nface habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the\nquaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost\ntheir owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and\nreserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his\ncheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.\nBut, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were\nprincipally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps\nsecond-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.\n\nCompleting his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,\nMr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,\nand he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:\n\n“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any\ntime to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a\ngentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”\n\n“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in\ntheir travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A\nvast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s House.”\n\n“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”\n\n“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,\nsir?”\n\n“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last\nfrom France.”\n\n“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s\ntime here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”\n\n“I believe so.”\n\n“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and\nCompany was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen\nyears ago?”\n\n“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from\nthe truth.”\n\n“Indeed, sir!”\n\nRounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the\ntable, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,\ndropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while\nhe ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the\nimmemorial usage of waiters in all ages.\n\nWhen Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on\nthe beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away\nfrom the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine\nostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling\nwildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was\ndestruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and\nbrought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong\na piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be\ndipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little\nfishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by\nnight, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide\nmade, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,\nsometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable\nthat nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\n\nAs the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been\nat intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became\nagain charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to cloud\ntoo. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting\nhis dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,\ndigging, digging, in the live red coals.\n\nA bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no\nharm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.\nMr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last\nglassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is\never to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has\ngot to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow\nstreet, and rumbled into the inn-yard.\n\nHe set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.\n\nIn a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette\nhad arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from\nTellson’s.\n\n“So soon?”\n\nMiss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none\nthen, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s\nimmediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.\n\nThe gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty his\nglass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen\nwig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment.\nIt was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black\nhorsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and\noiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room\nwere gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep\ngraves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected\nfrom them until they were dug out.\n\nThe obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his\nway over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for\nthe moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall\ncandles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and\nthe fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,\nand still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As\nhis eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden\nhair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and\na forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth\nit was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was\nnot quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright\nfixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his\neyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,\nof a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very\nChannel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran\nhigh. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of\nthe gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital\nprocession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were\noffering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the\nfeminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.\n\n“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a\nlittle foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.\n\n“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier\ndate, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.\n\n“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that\nsome intelligence--or discovery--”\n\n“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”\n\n“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so\nlong dead--”\n\nMr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the\nhospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for\nanybody in their absurd baskets!\n\n“--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate\nwith a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for\nthe purpose.”\n\n“Myself.”\n\n“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”\n\nShe curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a\npretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he\nwas than she. He made her another bow.\n\n“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by\nthose who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to\nFrance, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with\nme, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,\nduring the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection. The\ngentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to\nbeg the favour of his waiting for me here.”\n\n“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I shall\nbe more happy to execute it.”\n\n“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me\nby the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the\nbusiness, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising\nnature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a\nstrong and eager interest to know what they are.”\n\n“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes--I--”\n\nAfter a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the\nears, “It is very difficult to begin.”\n\nHe did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young\nforehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty\nand characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,\nas if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing\nshadow.\n\n“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”\n\n“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with\nan argumentative smile.\n\nBetween the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of\nwhich was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression\ndeepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which\nshe had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the\nmoment she raised her eyes again, went on:\n\n“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you\nas a young English lady, Miss Manette?”\n\n“If you please, sir.”\n\n“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to\nacquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than\nif I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with\nyour leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”\n\n“Story!”\n\nHe seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,\nin a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call\nour connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific\ngentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”\n\n“Not of Beauvais?”\n\n“Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\ngentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\ngentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.\nOur relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that\ntime in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.”\n\n“At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”\n\n“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and\nI was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other\nFrench gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands.\nIn a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for\nscores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;\nthere is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like\nsentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my\nbusiness life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in\nthe course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere\nmachine. To go on--”\n\n“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”--the\ncuriously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--“that when I was\nleft an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years,\nit was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.”\n\nMr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced\nto take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then\nconducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding\nthe chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub\nhis chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking\ndown into her face while she sat looking up into his.\n\n“Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself\njust now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold\nwith my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect\nthat I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of\nTellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of\nTellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance\nof them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary\nMangle.”\n\nAfter this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry\nflattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most\nunnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was\nbefore), and resumed his former attitude.\n\n“So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your\nregretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died\nwhen he did--Don’t be frightened! How you start!”\n\nShe did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.\n\n“Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from\nthe back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped\nhim in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of\nbusiness. As I was saying--”\n\nHer look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:\n\n“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly\nand silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not\nbeen difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could\ntrace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a\nprivilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid\nto speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the\nprivilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one\nto the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had\nimplored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of\nhim, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have\nbeen the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”\n\n“I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”\n\n“I will. I am going to. You can bear it?”\n\n“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this\nmoment.”\n\n“You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That’s good!” (Though\nhis manner was less satisfied than his words.) “A matter of business.\nRegard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now\nif this doctor’s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,\nhad suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was\nborn--”\n\n“The little child was a daughter, sir.”\n\n“A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don’t be distressed. Miss, if the\npoor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,\nthat she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the\ninheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by\nrearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don’t kneel! In\nHeaven’s name why should you kneel to me!”\n\n“For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”\n\n“A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact\nbusiness if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly\nmention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many\nshillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so\nmuch more at my ease about your state of mind.”\n\nWithout directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had\nvery gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp\nhis wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she\ncommunicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.\n\n“That’s right, that’s right. Courage! Business! You have business before\nyou; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with\nyou. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened\nher unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,\nto grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud\nupon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his\nheart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”\n\nAs he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the\nflowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have\nbeen already tinged with grey.\n\n“You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what\nthey had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new\ndiscovery, of money, or of any other property; but--”\n\nHe felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the\nforehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was\nnow immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.\n\n“But he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too\nprobable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.\nStill, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant\nin Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to\nrestore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”\n\nA shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a\nlow, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,\n\n“I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!”\n\nMr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. “There, there,\nthere! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.\nYou are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair\nsea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.”\n\nShe repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free, I\nhave been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”\n\n“Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a\nwholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under\nanother name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be\nworse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to\nknow whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly\nheld prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,\nbecause it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,\nanywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all\nevents--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even\nTellson’s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of\nthe matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring\nto it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,\nand memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, ‘Recalled to Life;’\nwhich may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn’t notice a\nword! Miss Manette!”\n\nPerfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she\nsat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed\nupon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or\nbranded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he\nfeared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called\nout loudly for assistance without moving.\n\nA wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to\nbe all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some\nextraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most\nwonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,\nor a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the\ninn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the\npoor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him\nflying back against the nearest wall.\n\n(“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry’s breathless\nreflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)\n\n“Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.\n“Why don’t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring\nat me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don’t you go and fetch\nthings? I’ll let you know, if you don’t bring smelling-salts, cold\nwater, and vinegar, quick, I will.”\n\nThere was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she\nsoftly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and\ngentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading her\ngolden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.\n\n“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;\n“couldn’t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her\nto death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do\nyou call _that_ being a Banker?”\n\nMr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to\nanswer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler\nsympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn\nservants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something\nnot mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a\nregular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head\nupon her shoulder.\n\n“I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry.\n\n“No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”\n\n“I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and\nhumility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”\n\n“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever\nintended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence\nwould have cast my lot in an island?”\n\nThis being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to\nconsider it.",

      "chapter_number": 5,
      "original_text": "The Wine-shop\n\nA large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The\naccident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled\nout with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just\noutside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.\n\nAll the people within reach had suspended their business, or their\nidleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular\nstones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have\nthought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,\nhad dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own\njostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,\nmade scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help\nwomen, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all\nrun out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in\nthe puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with\nhandkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’\nmouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;\nothers, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and\nthere, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new\ndirections; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed\npieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted\nfragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the\nwine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up\nalong with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,\nif anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous\npresence.\n\nA shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,\nand children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There\nwas little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a\nspecial companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part\nof every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the\nluckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,\nshaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen\ntogether. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been\nmost abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these\ndemonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who\nhad left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in\nmotion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of\nhot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own\nstarved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men\nwith bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into\nthe winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom\ngathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.\n\nThe wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street\nin the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had\nstained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many\nwooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks\non the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was\nstained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.\nThose who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a\ntigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his\nhead more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled\nupon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.\n\nThe time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the\nstreet-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.\n\nAnd now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary\ngleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was\nheavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in\nwaiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;\nbut, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a\nterrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the\nfabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,\npassed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered\nin every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which\nhad worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the\nchildren had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the\ngrown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,\nwas the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out\nof the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and\nlines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and\npaper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of\nfirewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless\nchimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,\namong its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the\nbaker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of\nbad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that\nwas offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting\nchestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every\nfarthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant\ndrops of oil.\n\nIts abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding\nstreet, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets\ndiverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags\nand nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them\nthat looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some\nwild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and\nslinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor\ncompressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted\ninto the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or\ninflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)\nwere, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman\npainted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of\nmeagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,\ncroaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were\ngloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a\nflourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives\nand axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the\ngunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,\nwith their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but\nbroke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down\nthe middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy\nrains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across\nthe streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and\npulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,\nand hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly\nmanner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and\nthe ship and crew were in peril of tempest.\n\nFor, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region\nshould have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so\nlong, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling\nup men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their\ncondition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over\nFrance shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of\nsong and feather, took no warning.\n\nThe wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its\nappearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside\nit, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle\nfor the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug\nof the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring\nanother.”\n\nThere, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,\nhe called to him across the way:\n\n“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”\n\nThe fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often\nthe way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is\noften the way with his tribe too.\n\n“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop\nkeeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of\nmud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you write\nin the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place\nto write such words in?”\n\nIn his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,\nperhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with his\nown, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing\nattitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his\nhand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly\npractical character, he looked, under those circumstances.\n\n“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish\nthere.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s\ndress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on\nhis account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.\n\nThis wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,\nand he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a\nbitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.\nHis shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to\nthe elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own\ncrisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good\neyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on\nthe whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong\nresolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing\ndown a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn\nthe man.\n\nMadame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he\ncame in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with\na watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand\nheavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of\nmanner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might\nhave predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself\nin any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being\nsensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright\nshawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large\nearrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick\nher teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported\nby her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but\ncoughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting\nof her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a\nline, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the\nshop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while\nhe stepped over the way.\n\nThe wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they\nrested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in\na corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing\ndominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply\nof wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the\nelderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”\n\n“What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge\nto himself; “I don’t know you.”\n\nBut, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse\nwith the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.\n\n“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is\nall the spilt wine swallowed?”\n\n“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.\n\nWhen this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,\npicking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,\nand raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n\n“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur\nDefarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or\nof anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”\n\n“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.\n\nAt this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still\nusing her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of\ncough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n\nThe last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty\ndrinking vessel and smacked his lips.\n\n“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle\nalways have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I\nright, Jacques?”\n\n“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.\n\nThis third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment\nwhen Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and\nslightly rustled in her seat.\n\n“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen--my wife!”\n\nThe three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three\nflourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and\ngiving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the\nwine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose\nof spirit, and became absorbed in it.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly\nupon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you\nwished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the\nfifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard\nclose to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of\nmy establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been\nthere, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”\n\nThey paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur\nDefarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly\ngentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.\n\n“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to\nthe door.\n\nTheir conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first\nword, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had\nnot lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then\nbeckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge\nknitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.\n\nMr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,\njoined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own\ncompany just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,\nand was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited\nby a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the\ngloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee\nto the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was\na gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable\ntransformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour\nin his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,\nangry, dangerous man.\n\n“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.”\nThus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began\nascending the stairs.\n\n“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.\n\n“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the\nsame low voice.\n\n“Is he always alone, then?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Of his own desire?”\n\n“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they\nfound me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be\ndiscreet--as he was then, so he is now.”\n\n“He is greatly changed?”\n\n“Changed!”\n\nThe keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,\nand mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so\nforcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his\ntwo companions ascended higher and higher.\n\nSuch a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded\nparts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile\nindeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation\nwithin the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,\nthe room or rooms within every door that opened on the general\nstaircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides\nflinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and\nhopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted\nthe air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their\nintangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost\ninsupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt\nand poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to\nhis young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.\nJarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made\nat a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left\nuncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed\nto crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were\ncaught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer\nor lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any\npromise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.\n\nAt last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the\nthird time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination\nand of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story\nwas reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in\nadvance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he\ndreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about\nhere, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over\nhis shoulder, took out a key.\n\n“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.\n\n“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.\n\n“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”\n\n“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it\ncloser in his ear, and frowned heavily.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\nfrightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what\nharm--if his door was left open.”\n\n“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.\n\n“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful\nworld we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things\nare possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under\nthat sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”\n\nThis dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word\nof it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she trembled\nunder such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,\nand, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent\non him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\n\n“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a\nmoment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,\nall the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you\nbring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.\nThat’s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”\n\nThey went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were\nsoon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at\nonce in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at\nthe side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which\nthe door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing\nfootsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed\nthemselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the\nwine-shop.\n\n“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur\nDefarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”\n\nThe three glided by, and went silently down.\n\nThere appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of\nthe wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.\nLorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\n\n“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”\n\n“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”\n\n“Is that well?”\n\n“_I_ think it is well.”\n\n“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”\n\n“I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the\nsight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another\nthing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”\n\nWith an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in\nthrough the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck\ntwice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to\nmake a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,\nthree or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned\nit as heavily as he could.\n\nThe door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the\nroom and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more\nthan a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\n\nHe looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry\ngot his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he\nfelt that she was sinking.\n\n“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of\nbusiness shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”\n\n“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.\n\n“Of it? What?”\n\n“I mean of him. Of my father.”\n\nRendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of\ntheir conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\nshoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her\ndown just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\n\nDefarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\ntook out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,\nmethodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\ncould make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to\nwhere the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.\n\nThe garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim\nand dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the\nroof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\nthe street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\nother door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this\ndoor was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.\nSuch a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it\nwas difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit\nalone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\nrequiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being\ndone in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\ntowards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at\nhim, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very\nbusy, making shoes.",

          "The Wine-shop\n\nA large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street.",
          "The\naccident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled\nout with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just\noutside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.\n\n",
          "All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their\nidleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine.",
          "The rough, irregular\nstones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have\nthought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,\nhad dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own\njostling group or crowd, according to its size.",
          "Some men kneeled down,\nmade scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help\nwomen, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all\nrun out between their fingers.",
          "Others, men and women, dipped in\nthe puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with\nhandkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’\nmouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;\nothers, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and\nthere, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new\ndirections; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed\npieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted\nfragments with eager relish.",
          "There was no drainage to carry off the\nwine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up\nalong with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,\nif anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous\npresence.\n\n",
          "A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,\nand children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted.",
          "There\nwas little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness.",
          "There was a\nspecial companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part\nof every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the\nluckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,\nshaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen\ntogether.",
          "When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been\nmost abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these\ndemonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out.",
          "The man who\nhad left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in\nmotion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of\nhot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own\nstarved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men\nwith bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into\nthe winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom\ngathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.\n\n",
          "The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street\nin the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled.",
          "It had\nstained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many\nwooden shoes.",
          "The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks\non the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was\nstained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.\n",
          "Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a\ntigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his\nhead more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled\nupon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.\n\n",
          "The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the\nstreet-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.\n\n",
          "And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary\ngleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was\nheavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in\nwaiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;\n",
          "but, most especially the last.",
          "Samples of a people that had undergone a\nterrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the\nfabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,\npassed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered\nin every vestige of a garment that the wind shook."
