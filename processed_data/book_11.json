      "original_text": "Down the Rabbit-Hole\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n“without pictures or conversations?”\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.\n\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope.”\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.\n\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!”\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *",

      "original_text": "The Pool of Tears\n\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.”\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n_Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\nAlice’s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\n\n“How doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!”\n\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\ncats.”\n\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\n\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\nagain!”\n\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.\n\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",

      "original_text": "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\n\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\nyou speak?”\n\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\n\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\n\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\n\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\n\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?”\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\n\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\ndry me at all.”\n\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\nremedies—”\n\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\ntittered audibly.\n\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\n\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\none a-piece, all round.\n\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\n\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\n\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\ncheered.\n\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\nshe could.\n\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\nwould be offended again.\n\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\nsighing.\n\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\ntale was something like this:—\n\n“Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\ngo to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\ndenial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\nnothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\nsir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\n‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\ntry the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\n\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\nyou thinking of?”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\nbend, I think?”\n\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\n\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\n\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\nyou know!”\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\n\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\n\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\nLory.\n\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\nalone.\n\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story.",

      "original_text": "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\n\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\n\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made.\n\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.\n\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\ndrunk quite so much!”\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\n\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\n\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\n\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\nfor any lesson-books!”\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\ngo round and get in at the window.”\n\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!”\n\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\n\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\n\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\nwindow!”\n\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\n\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\n\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\n\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\nto see what would happen next.\n\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\nus all about it!”\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\n\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\n\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\n\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\nsafe in a thick wood.\n\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\nwill be the best plan.”\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\ngreat hurry.\n\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\nspite of all her coaxing.\n\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\nquestion is, what?”\n\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\nanything else.",

      "original_text": "Advice from a Caterpillar\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\nyourself!”\n\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\nnot myself, you see.”\n\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\n\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\nqueer, won’t you?”\n\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\n\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\n\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\n\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\n\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away.\n\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\nimportant to say!”\n\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.\n\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\n\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\n\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\n“Repeat, ‘_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\n\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\n“And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?”\n\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\n“I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\nPray, what is the reason of that?”\n\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n“I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\nAllow me to sell you a couple?”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\nPray, how did you manage to do it?”\n\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\nWhat made you so awfully clever?”\n\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\nSaid his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\n\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\nwords have got altered.”\n\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes.\n\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\n\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\n\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\n\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\n\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\noffended!”\n\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.”\n\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\nherself.\n\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n* * * * * *\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\n\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!”\n\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\n\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\n\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\n\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\ninvent something!”\n\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!”\n\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\n\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\n\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",
