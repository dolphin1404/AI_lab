      "original_text": "Epilogue\n\nOriginal Transcriber’s Notes:\n\nThis text is a combination of etexts, one from the now-defunct ERIS\nproject at Virginia Tech and one from Project Gutenberg’s archives. The\nproofreaders of this version are indebted to The University of Adelaide\nLibrary for preserving the Virginia Tech version. The resulting etext\nwas compared with a public domain hard copy version of the text.\n\nETYMOLOGY.\n\n(Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School.)\n\nThe pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him\nnow. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer\nhandkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the\nknown nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it\nsomehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.\n\n“While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what\nname a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through\nignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the\nsignification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.”\n—_Hackluyt._\n\n“WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. _hval_. This animal is named from\nroundness or rolling; for in Dan. _hvalt_ is arched or vaulted.”\n—_Webster’s Dictionary._\n\n“WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. _Wallen_;\nA.S. _Walw-ian_, to roll, to wallow.” —_Richardson’s Dictionary._\n\n‏חו‎, _Hebrew_.\nϰητος, _Greek_.\nCETUS, _Latin_.\nWHŒL, _Anglo-Saxon_.\nHVALT, _Danish_.\nWAL, _Dutch_.\nHWAL, _Swedish_.\nHVALUR, _Icelandic_.\nWHALE, _English_.\nBALEINE, _French_.\nBALLENA, _Spanish_.\nPEKEE-NUEE-NUEE, _Fegee_.\nPEHEE-NUEE-NUEE, _Erromangoan_.\n\nEXTRACTS. (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).\n\nIt will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of\na poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long\nVaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random\nallusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,\nsacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least,\ntake the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in\nthese extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As\ntouching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here\nappearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as\naffording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously\nsaid, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and\ngenerations, including our own.\n\nSo fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.\nThou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this\nworld will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too\nrosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel\npoor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them\nbluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether\nunpleasant sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more\npains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for\never go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the\nTuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the\nroyal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before\nare clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of\nlong-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.\nHere ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike\nunsplinterable glasses!\n\nEXTRACTS.\n\n“And God created great whales.” —_Genesis_.\n\n“Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep\nto be hoary.” —_Job_.\n\n“Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.”\n—_Jonah_.\n\n“There go the ships; there is that Leviathan whom thou hast made to\nplay therein.” —_Psalms_.\n\n“In that day, the Lord with his sore, and great, and strong sword,\nshall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that\ncrooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.”\n—_Isaiah_.\n\n“And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this\nmonster’s mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all\nincontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the\nbottomless gulf of his paunch.” —_Holland’s Plutarch’s Morals_.\n\n“The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are:\namong which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as\nmuch in length as four acres or arpens of land.” —_Holland’s Pliny_.\n\n“Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a\ngreat many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the\nformer, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us,\nopen-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea\nbefore him into a foam.” —_Tooke’s Lucian_. “_The True History_.”\n\n“He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales,\nwhich had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he\nbrought some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own\ncountry, of which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He\nsaid that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days.”\n—_Other or Other’s verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King\nAlfred, A.D._ 890.\n\n“And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that\nenter into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s (whale’s) mouth, are\nimmediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in\ngreat security, and there sleeps.” —MONTAIGNE. —_Apology for Raimond\nSebond_.\n\n“Let us fly, let us fly! Old Nick take me if it is not Leviathan\ndescribed by the noble prophet Moses in the life of patient Job.”\n—_Rabelais_.\n\n“This whale’s liver was two cartloads.” —_Stowe’s Annals_.\n\n“The great Leviathan that maketh the seas to seethe like boiling\npan.” —_Lord Bacon’s Version of the Psalms_.\n\n“Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have received\nnothing certain. They grow exceeding fat, insomuch that an incredible\nquantity of oil will be extracted out of one whale.” —_Ibid_.\n“_History of Life and Death_.”\n\n“The sovereignest thing on earth is parmacetti for an inward bruise.”\n—_King Henry_.\n\n“Very like a whale.” —_Hamlet_.\n\n“Which to secure, no skill of leach’s art Mote him availle, but to\nreturne againe To his wound’s worker, that with lowly dart, Dinting\nhis breast, had bred his restless paine, Like as the wounded whale to\nshore flies thro’ the maine.” —_The Fairie Queen_.\n\n“Immense as whales, the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful\ncalm trouble the ocean till it boil.” —_Sir William Davenant. Preface\nto Gondibert_.\n\n“What spermacetti is, men might justly doubt, since the learned\nHosmannus in his work of thirty years, saith plainly, _Nescio quid\nsit_.” —_Sir T. Browne. Of Sperma Ceti and the Sperma Ceti Whale.\nVide his V. E._\n\n“Like Spencer’s Talus with his modern flail He threatens ruin with\nhis ponderous tail. ... Their fixed jav’lins in his side he wears,\nAnd on his back a grove of pikes appears.” —_Waller’s Battle of the\nSummer Islands_.\n\n“By art is created that great Leviathan, called a Commonwealth or\nState—(in Latin, Civitas) which is but an artificial man.” —_Opening\nsentence of Hobbes’s Leviathan_.\n\n“Silly Mansoul swallowed it without chewing, as if it had been a\nsprat in the mouth of a whale.” —_Pilgrim’s Progress_.\n\n“That sea beast Leviathan, which God of all his works Created hugest\nthat swim the ocean stream.” —_Paradise Lost_.\n\n—“There Leviathan, Hugest of living creatures, in the deep Stretched\nlike a promontory sleeps or swims, And seems a moving land; and at\nhis gills Draws in, and at his breath spouts out a sea.” —_Ibid_.\n\n“The mighty whales which swim in a sea of water, and have a sea of\noil swimming in them.” —_Fuller’s Profane and Holy State_.\n\n“So close behind some promontory lie The huge Leviathan to attend\ntheir prey, And give no chance, but swallow in the fry, Which through\ntheir gaping jaws mistake the way.” —_Dryden’s Annus Mirabilis_.\n\n“While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they cut off\nhis head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it will come;\nbut it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water.” —_Thomas\nEdge’s Ten Voyages to Spitzbergen, in Purchas_.\n\n“In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, and in\nwantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes and vents, which\nnature has placed on their shoulders.” —_Sir T. Herbert’s Voyages\ninto Asia and Africa. Harris Coll_.\n\n“Here they saw such huge troops of whales, that they were forced to\nproceed with a great deal of caution for fear they should run their\nship upon them.” —_Schouten’s Sixth Circumnavigation_.\n\n“We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The\nJonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but\nthat is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether\nthey can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his\npains.... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a\nbarrel of herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me\nthat he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.”\n—_A Voyage to Greenland, A.D._ 1671. _Harris Coll_.\n\n“Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one\neighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was\ninformed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight of\nbaleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of Pitferren.”\n—_Sibbald’s Fife and Kinross_.\n\n“Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this\nSperma-ceti whale, for I could never hear of any of that sort that\nwas killed by any man, such is his fierceness and swiftness.”\n—_Richard Strafford’s Letter from the Bermudas. Phil. Trans. A.D._\n1668.\n\n“Whales in the sea God’s voice obey.” —_N. E. Primer_.\n\n“We saw also abundance of large whales, there being more in those\nsouthern seas, as I may say, by a hundred to one; than we have to the\nnorthward of us.” —_Captain Cowley’s Voyage round the Globe, A.D._\n1729.\n\n“... and the breath of the whale is frequently attended with such an\ninsupportable smell, as to bring on a disorder of the brain.”\n—_Ulloa’s South America_.\n\n“To fifty chosen sylphs of special note, We trust the important\ncharge, the petticoat. Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to\nfail, Tho’ stuffed with hoops and armed with ribs of whale.” —_Rape\nof the Lock_.\n\n“If we compare land animals in respect to magnitude, with those that\ntake up their abode in the deep, we shall find they will appear\ncontemptible in the comparison. The whale is doubtless the largest\nanimal in creation.” —_Goldsmith, Nat. Hist_.\n\n“If you should write a fable for little fishes, you would make them\nspeak like great whales.” —_Goldsmith to Johnson_.\n\n“In the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but it was\nfound to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed, and were\nthen towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves\nbehind the whale, in order to avoid being seen by us.” —_Cook’s\nVoyages_.\n\n“The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so\ngreat dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to\nmention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood,\nand some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order\nto terrify and prevent their too near approach.” —_Uno Von Troil’s\nLetters on Banks’s and Solander’s Voyage to Iceland in_ 1772.\n\n“The Spermacetti Whale found by the Nantuckois, is an active, fierce\nanimal, and requires vast address and boldness in the fishermen.”\n—_Thomas Jefferson’s Whale Memorial to the French minister in_ 1778.\n\n“And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?” —_Edmund Burke’s\nreference in Parliament to the Nantucket Whale-Fishery_.\n\n“Spain—a great whale stranded on the shores of Europe.” —_Edmund\nBurke_. (_somewhere_.)\n\n“A tenth branch of the king’s ordinary revenue, said to be grounded\non the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from\npirates and robbers, is the right to _royal_ fish, which are whale\nand sturgeon. And these, when either thrown ashore or caught near the\ncoast, are the property of the king.” —_Blackstone_.\n\n“Soon to the sport of death the crews repair: Rodmond unerring o’er\nhis head suspends The barbed steel, and every turn attends.”\n—_Falconer’s Shipwreck_.\n\n“Bright shone the roofs, the domes, the spires, And rockets blew self\ndriven, To hang their momentary fire Around the vault of heaven.\n\n“So fire with water to compare, The ocean serves on high, Up-spouted\nby a whale in air, To express unwieldy joy.” —_Cowper, on the Queen’s\nVisit to London_.\n\n“Ten or fifteen gallons of blood are thrown out of the heart at a\nstroke, with immense velocity.” —_John Hunter’s account of the\ndissection of a whale_. (_A small sized one_.)\n\n“The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the\nwater-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage\nthrough that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood\ngushing from the whale’s heart.” —_Paley’s Theology_.\n\n“The whale is a mammiferous animal without hind feet.” —_Baron\nCuvier_.\n\n“In 40 degrees south, we saw Spermacetti Whales, but did not take any\ntill the first of May, the sea being then covered with them.”\n—_Colnett’s Voyage for the Purpose of Extending the Spermaceti Whale\nFishery_.\n\n“In the free element beneath me swam, Floundered and dived, in play,\nin chace, in battle, Fishes of every colour, form, and kind; Which\nlanguage cannot paint, and mariner Had never seen; from dread\nLeviathan To insect millions peopling every wave: Gather’d in shoals\nimmense, like floating islands, Led by mysterious instincts through\nthat waste And trackless region, though on every side Assaulted by\nvoracious enemies, Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm’d in front or\njaw, With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.”\n—_Montgomery’s World before the Flood_.\n\n“Io! Paean! Io! sing. To the finny people’s king. Not a mightier\nwhale than this In the vast Atlantic is; Not a fatter fish than he,\nFlounders round the Polar Sea.” —_Charles Lamb’s Triumph of the\nWhale_.\n\n“In the year 1690 some persons were on a high hill observing the\nwhales spouting and sporting with each other, when one observed:\nthere—pointing to the sea—is a green pasture where our children’s\ngrand-children will go for bread.” —_Obed Macy’s History of\nNantucket_.\n\n“I built a cottage for Susan and myself and made a gateway in the\nform of a Gothic Arch, by setting up a whale’s jaw bones.”\n—_Hawthorne’s Twice Told Tales_.\n\n“She came to bespeak a monument for her first love, who had been\nkilled by a whale in the Pacific ocean, no less than forty years\nago.” —_Ibid_.\n\n“No, Sir, ’tis a Right Whale,” answered Tom; “I saw his sprout; he\nthrew up a pair of as pretty rainbows as a Christian would wish to\nlook at. He’s a raal oil-butt, that fellow!” —_Cooper’s Pilot_.\n\n“The papers were brought in, and we saw in the Berlin Gazette that\nwhales had been introduced on the stage there.” —_Eckermann’s\nConversations with Goethe_.\n\n“My God! Mr. Chace, what is the matter?” I answered, “we have been\nstove by a whale.” —“_Narrative of the Shipwreck of the Whale Ship\nEssex of Nantucket, which was attacked and finally destroyed by a\nlarge Sperm Whale in the Pacific Ocean_.” _By Owen Chace of\nNantucket, first mate of said vessel. New York_, 1821.\n\n“A mariner sat in the shrouds one night, The wind was piping free;\nNow bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale, And the phospher\ngleamed in the wake of the whale, As it floundered in the sea.”\n—_Elizabeth Oakes Smith_.\n\n“The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture\nof this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six\nEnglish miles....\n\n“Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which,\ncracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four\nmiles.” —_Scoresby_.\n\n“Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the\ninfuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous\nhead, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he\nrushes at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with\nvast swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.... It is a matter of\ngreat astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so\ninteresting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an\nanimal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected,\nor should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and\nmany of them competent observers, that of late years, must have\npossessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of\nwitnessing their habitudes.” —_Thomas Beale’s History of the Sperm\nWhale_, 1839.\n\n“The Cachalot” (Sperm Whale) “is not only better armed than the True\nWhale” (Greenland or Right Whale) “in possessing a formidable weapon\nat either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a\ndisposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once\nso artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as\nthe most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale\ntribe.” —_Frederick Debell Bennett’s Whaling Voyage Round the Globe_,\n1840.\n\nOctober 13. “There she blows,” was sung out from the mast-head.\n“Where away?” demanded the captain. “Three points off the lee bow,\nsir.” “Raise up your wheel. Steady!” “Steady, sir.” “Mast-head\nahoy! Do you see that whale now?” “Ay ay, sir! A shoal of Sperm\nWhales! There she blows! There she breaches!” “Sing out! sing out\nevery time!” “Ay Ay, sir! There she blows! there—there—_thar_ she\nblows—bowes—bo-o-os!” “How far off?” “Two miles and a half.” “Thunder\nand lightning! so near! Call all hands.” —_J. Ross Browne’s Etchings\nof a Whaling Cruize_. 1846.\n\n“The Whale-ship Globe, on board of which vessel occurred the horrid\ntransactions we are about to relate, belonged to the island of\nNantucket.” —“_Narrative of the Globe Mutiny_,” _by Lay and Hussey\nsurvivors. A.D._ 1828.\n\nBeing once pursued by a whale which he had wounded, he parried the\nassault for some time with a lance; but the furious monster at length\nrushed on the boat; himself and comrades only being preserved by\nleaping into the water when they saw the onset was inevitable.”\n—_Missionary Journal of Tyerman and Bennett_.\n\n“Nantucket itself,” said Mr. Webster, “is a very striking and\npeculiar portion of the National interest. There is a population of\neight or nine thousand persons living here in the sea, adding largely\nevery year to the National wealth by the boldest and most persevering\nindustry.” —_Report of Daniel Webster’s Speech in the U. S. Senate,\non the application for the Erection of a Breakwater at Nantucket_.\n1828.\n\n“The whale fell directly over him, and probably killed him in a\nmoment.” —“_The Whale and his Captors, or The Whaleman’s Adventures\nand the Whale’s Biography, gathered on the Homeward Cruise of the\nCommodore Preble_.” _By Rev. Henry T. Cheever_.\n\n“If you make the least damn bit of noise,” replied Samuel, “I will\nsend you to hell.” —_Life of Samuel Comstock_ (_the mutineer_), _by\nhis brother, William Comstock. Another Version of the whale-ship\nGlobe narrative_.\n\n“The voyages of the Dutch and English to the Northern Ocean, in\norder, if possible, to discover a passage through it to India, though\nthey failed of their main object, laid-open the haunts of the whale.”\n—_McCulloch’s Commercial Dictionary_.\n\n“These things are reciprocal; the ball rebounds, only to bound\nforward again; for now in laying open the haunts of the whale, the\nwhalemen seem to have indirectly hit upon new clews to that same\nmystic North-West Passage.” —_From_ “_Something_” _unpublished_.\n\n“It is impossible to meet a whale-ship on the ocean without being\nstruck by her near appearance. The vessel under short sail, with\nlook-outs at the mast-heads, eagerly scanning the wide expanse around\nthem, has a totally different air from those engaged in regular\nvoyage.” —_Currents and Whaling. U.S. Ex. Ex_.\n\n“Pedestrians in the vicinity of London and elsewhere may recollect\nhaving seen large curved bones set upright in the earth, either to\nform arches over gateways, or entrances to alcoves, and they may\nperhaps have been told that these were the ribs of whales.” —_Tales\nof a Whale Voyager to the Arctic Ocean_.\n\n“It was not till the boats returned from the pursuit of these whales,\nthat the whites saw their ship in bloody possession of the savages\nenrolled among the crew.” —_Newspaper Account of the Taking and\nRetaking of the Whale-Ship Hobomack_.\n\n“It is generally well known that out of the crews of Whaling vessels\n(American) few ever return in the ships on board of which they\ndeparted.” —_Cruise in a Whale Boat_.\n\n“Suddenly a mighty mass emerged from the water, and shot up\nperpendicularly into the air. It was the whale.” —_Miriam Coffin or\nthe Whale Fisherman_.\n\n“The Whale is harpooned to be sure; but bethink you, how you would\nmanage a powerful unbroken colt, with the mere appliance of a rope\ntied to the root of his tail.” —_A Chapter on Whaling in Ribs and\nTrucks_.\n\n“On one occasion I saw two of these monsters (whales) probably male\nand female, slowly swimming, one after the other, within less than a\nstone’s throw of the shore” (Terra Del Fuego), “over which the beech\ntree extended its branches.” —_Darwin’s Voyage of a Naturalist_.\n\n“‘Stern all!’ exclaimed the mate, as upon turning his head, he saw\nthe distended jaws of a large Sperm Whale close to the head of the\nboat, threatening it with instant destruction;—‘Stern all, for your\nlives!’” —_Wharton the Whale Killer_.\n\n“So be cheery, my lads, let your hearts never fail, While the bold\nharpooneer is striking the whale!” —_Nantucket Song_.\n\n“Oh, the rare old Whale, mid storm and gale In his ocean home will be\nA giant in might, where might is right, And King of the boundless\nsea.” —_Whale Song_.",

      "original_text": "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\non shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\nof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\nthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\nI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\nmy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\nprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\nmethodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to\nget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\nquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\nbut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\ncherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her\nsurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\n\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\ndo you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?\n\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of\nthem—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\nand avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\nme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\nthose ships attract them thither?\n\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\nit. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\nreveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\ninfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\nprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\never.\n\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\nof the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\ntrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\nwithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\nfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\nwinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\ntheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\nthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\nshepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were\nfixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\nTiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop\nof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel\nyour thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\nsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy\nhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\ntrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\n\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\nget sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy\nthemselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\nAnd as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I\nnever fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\nin time.\n\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\nand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t\na slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\norder me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\none way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,\nand be content.\n\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\npaid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\nourselves to perdition!\n\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\nthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\nso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\nother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\nsome unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in\nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\nperformances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\nsomething like this:\n\n“_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._\n“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”\n\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\nFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short\nand easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I\ncannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\ncircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\nme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\nand discriminating judgment.\n\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\nhimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\nhelped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\nwould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\nland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let\nme—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\nthe place one lodges in.\n\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\nall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.",

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.",
      "chapter_number": 3,
      "original_text": "I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city\nof old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night\nin December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\npacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\nthat place would offer, till the following Monday.\n\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\nwas her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the\nfirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\nimported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\nbowsprit?\n\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\nvery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\nand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\nnorth with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\ninquire the price, and don’t be too particular.\n\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The\nCrossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further\non, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came\nsuch fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\nice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\nten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,\nwhen I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from\nhard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\nmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\nstopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\nthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\nthe cheeriest inns.\n\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\nand here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\ninvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\nuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\nover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\nGomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then\nmust needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\ndoor.\n\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\nDoom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\npreacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\nand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’\n\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\nunderneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\n\nCoffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\nI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\n\nIt was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\nas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\never it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\nhob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\ncalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\nonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\nglazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\nmind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\nhere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\nwrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\n\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\nto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\nthan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\norder to keep out this frost?\n\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\nmoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\nCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\ntemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\n\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there\nis plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted\nfeet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.",

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.",
      "chapter_number": 4,
      "original_text": "Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\nEngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\nentry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\nwild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\n\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\nnameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\na nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\nit, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight\ngale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a\nblasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\nthat one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found\nout, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\nresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?\n\nIn fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\nwhom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\nin a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\nthree dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\npurposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\nimpaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\n\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\narray of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\nmower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\nand savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\nand harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\nSwain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\nharpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\nwas found imbedded in the hump.\n\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\nfireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place\nis this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\nplanks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s\ncockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\nold ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\ngathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\nfurther angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude\nattempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\nvast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\ndrive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\nthe sailors deliriums and death.\n\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\ncylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\nrudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to\n_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;\nand so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\ndown for a shilling.\n\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\na table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\na room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed\nunoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no\nobjections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are\ngoin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”\n\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\nif he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\nthe half of any decent man’s blanket.\n\n“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?\nSupper’ll be ready directly.”\n\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\nhis jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\nbetween his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\nhe didn’t make much headway, I thought.\n\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said\nhe couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\nfare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but\ndumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\nmanner.\n\n“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead\nsartainty.”\n\n“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”\n\n“Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\ndon’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”\n\n“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”\n\n“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.\n\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark\ncomplexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\nturned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into\nbed before I did.\n\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\nwhat else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\nevening as a looker on.\n\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\ncried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing\nthis morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\nwe’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”\n\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\nshaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\nall bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\nseemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\ntheir boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\nthat they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\nor on the weather side of an ice-island.\n\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\ncapering about most obstreperously.\n\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\nnoise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\nwill here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\nfeet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\nburnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\nto give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\nthose tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\nthem, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s\nBulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\n\nIt was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\nentrance of the seamen.\n\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\nsleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\nand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\nmidnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\n\n“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep\nwith him. I’ll try the bench here.”\n\n“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a\nmattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and\nnotches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane\nthere in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying\nhe procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\nthe bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\nlike an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\nplane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\nthe middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\nbrown study.\n\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\nthan the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\nnight.\n\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal\na march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began\nto think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\nagainst this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be\ndropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.\n\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\nand going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n\n“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such\nlate hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.\n\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he\nanswered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to\nrise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\na peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,\nunless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”\n\n“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\ntelling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,\nlandlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\nthis town?”\n\n“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\nsell it here, the market’s overstocked.”\n\n“With what?” shouted I.\n\n“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\n\n“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better\nstop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”\n\n“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I\nrayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a\nslanderin’ his head.”\n\n“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at\nthis unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.\n\n“It’s broke a’ready,” said he.\n\n“Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”\n\n“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”\n\n“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\nsnow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have\nnot yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,\nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\ndegree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\nnight with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\nthat story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of\nsleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,\nsir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render\nyourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”\n\n“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long\nsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be\neasy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived\nfrom the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand\nheads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and\nthat one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it\nwould not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is\ngoin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as\nhe was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for\nall the airth like a string of inions.”\n\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\nthat the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the\nsame time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\nSaturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\nbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n\n“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”\n\n“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful\nlate, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me\nslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room\nfor two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,\nafore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\nfoot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\nsomehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\nArter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a\nglim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\nme, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\nharpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;\n_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”\n\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\nushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\nwith a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\nharpooneers to sleep abreast.\n\n“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\nthat did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make\nyourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from\neyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\nthe most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\nthe four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\nwhale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\nhammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\nlarge seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in\nlieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\nstanding at the head of the bed.\n\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\nlight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it\nto nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\nIndian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as\nyou see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\nstreets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\nand thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\nharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\nlife. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\nin the neck.\n\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\nthe bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\nthe middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\nlittle more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\nhalf undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\nthe harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\nlate, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\nand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\nto the care of heaven.\n\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\nsleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard\na heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into\nthe room from under the door.\n\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\nthe floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\ncords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\nall eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\nwhile employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,\nhe turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\nof a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\nlarge blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a\nterrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\nface so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\nstains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\nof a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had\nbeen tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\nof his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\nsun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\nall. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\nfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\nseal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\nthe middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\nthing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\nhat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\nThere was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.\n\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\nit was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\nhead-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\nthe dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\nenough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\nhis chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\ncheckered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’\nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\nin the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\nthink of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own\nbrothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\nthat he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\nor dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\nthe pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\nwith a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old\nCongo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\na good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\ngoes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\nsets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\nandirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\nso that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\nor chapel for his Congo idol.\n\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\nill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\nthem carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\na sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\nidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\nI had so long been bound.\n\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\nan instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\nhandle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\nhis teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\nnow; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\n\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\nmeaning.\n\n“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\ndark.\n\n“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!\nCoffin! Angels! save me!”\n\n“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\nhot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\nBut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\nin hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n\n“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t\nharm a hair of your head.”\n\n“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that\ninfernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”\n\n“I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads\naround town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look\nhere—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”\n\n“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\nsitting up in bed.\n\n“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\nthrowing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\nlooking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,\nthought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just\nas much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n\n“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\nwhatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\nturn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with\nme. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”\n\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\nmotioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to\nsay—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”\n\n“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”\n\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.",

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.",
      "chapter_number": 5,
      "original_text": "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\nthought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\nodd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\ntattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his\nkeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I\nsay, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\nquilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\ntogether; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\ncould tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\n\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\nchild, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\nwhether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\nbed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\nbefore I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\nof my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\nshining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\nand worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\nher feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\nmost conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\nI have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\nAt last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\nslowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the\nbefore sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\na shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\nsilent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\nseated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\never thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\naway from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\nall, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\noften puzzle myself with it.\n\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm\nthrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his\nbridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\nas though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\nhim—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\nneck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\nsleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\nbed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\na man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well\nworth unusual regarding.\n\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\none, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\nnext movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\never heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\nboots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\nstage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\nones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\nI begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\nparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\nand commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\ncorner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\na little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\nwall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\nto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\n\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\nthe room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\nharpoon like a marshal’s baton.",
